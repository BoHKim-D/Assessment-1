// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements.
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testiong & Integration
// 6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step where you determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements to do so, can also include defining needed resources to build the project."
const desgin = "This is the third step where you put specifications of the project into a design plan into different steps, these steps can include a lot of things such as Architecture of the build, UI, platforms, programming, communications or security."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step where a actual coding part of the project starts, developers follows the guidelines of previous steps and put it into coding."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step where the project gets put into multiple tests to make sure it meets the requirements and specifications that was planned originally and then the project is made avaiable to end-users."
const maintain = "This is the last step where the project is being used in the field and the end-users can find bugs that weren't found during the testing phase or errors and the developer resolve them then cycle begins."
